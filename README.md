## Deep-history
The aim of this project is to give you a deeper look at your browsing/network history. 
# Browser history
History in most of the browser gives you just the links you visit. Many websites have contents  embeded from third party  websites. So if you are always on facebook watching youtube videos embeded on your timeline, the browser history just says that you visited facebook. It does not tell you what kind of content you consumed.
# Network history
Today we use many apps that connect directly to internet. This is true specifically on mobile. There is no way to track the history of traffic generated by these apps.
